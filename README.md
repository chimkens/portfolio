Fullstack nano project 1


This is a project for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. It displays a personal portfolio on a basic web page. This is an excercise to learn HTML and CSS basics. 

Instructions to Run:
1) clone the github repo
2) run the command "npm install"
3) run the index.html file, you may have to specify the run url configuration which I put as
"http://localhost:63343/CWPortfolio/public/index.html"
4) Go to the url you specified in step 3 and you should see the portfolio page

Lanuages Excercised:
CSS, HTML
